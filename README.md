# Kubecost Cloud agent helm chart

This repo provides the helm chart for installing the Kubecost Cloud agent into a kube cluster.
It borrows heavily from the [cost-analyzer helm chart](https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer-helm-chart)
as many of the base components are similar to installing the Kubecost Self-Hosted solution.

To install using this helm chart, please use the helm install command that can be found in
the Kubecost Cloud UI.
